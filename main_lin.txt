/boot - file contains OS Kernel usually lives here
/etc - critical system and configuration files
/sbin && /bin - for important utilities
/tmp - for temporary files
/dev - was traditionally part of the root fs but these days it's virt fs
/lib && /lib64 - shared library files and a few other oddments such as c preprocessor. sometimes these items was have been moved to /usr/lib
/usr - where most standart-but-not-system-critical programs are kept
/var - houses spool dirs,logs,accounting information and various other items that grow or change rapidly and that vary on each host

4000 and 2000 are setuid\setgid bits. when setgid is set on a directory, newly will take on the group ownership rather than the user who created the file

1000 If the sticky bit is set on a directory, the filesystem wonâ€™t allow you to delete
or rename a file unless you are the owner of the directory, the owner of the
file, or the superuser

Some other ls options that are important to know are -a to show all entries in
a directory (even files whose names start with a dot), -t to sort files by
modification time (or -tr to sort in reverse chronological order), -F to show
the names of files in a way that distinguishes directories and executable files,
-R to list recursively, and -h to show file sizes in human-readable form (e.g.,
8K or 53M)
